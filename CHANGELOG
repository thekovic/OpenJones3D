v0.1
General:
  - Fixed minor bugs
  - Improve game loading times by disabling VSync and blt frame buffers instead of flip.
  - Changed DPI awareness to per monitor aware v2
  - Added check for NAN value of provided angle in `stdMath_SinCos`
  - Fixed issue with float precision in `stdMath_NormalizeAngle` which could result in angles larger than 360 degrees.
    This fixes array out of bound read in `stdMath_SinCos`, which fixes random crash when opening inventory menu or calling COG function `JonesInvItemChanged` from script.
  - Fixed deleting hdc on pixel data read error in `stdBmp_Load`
  - Fixed reading/writing 24 bpp pixel from bytes in `stdColor_ColorConvertOneRow`.
    This fixes conversion of 24bit RGB image.
  - Fixed exit code (0) when app successfully exits
  - Fixed infinitive loop when call to `wkernel_pfProcess` returned value other than -1, 0 or 1 (`wkernel_Run`)
  - Fixed copying full pixel data row from source mipmap in `std3D_AllocSystemTexture`. Originally was fixed to 16 bpp row.
  - (`JonesFile`) Fixed path buffer size to 128 chars, was 48 chars
  - (`JonesFile`) Fixed writing to file by using correct file write function in `JonesFile_FilePrintf`
  - Added bounds check for number of animating joints when loading keyframe from *.key file
  - Made save/load dialogs resizable
  - Fixed a bug in sound compression where clipping of the audio waveform occurred
  - Fixed infinitive loop bug when voice subtitle contains too long word (`sithVoice_AddSubtitle`)

  - Fixed accessing null pointer in `sithWhip_Reset` when `sithCamera` is already closed.
    Fixed checking for null `sithWeapon_SendMessageAim` before calling function`sithWeapon_IsLocalPlayerUnableToUseWeapon` in `sithWeapon_SendMessageAim` functions.
    This 2 fixes solve the game crash when player is aiming with whip and exits the game/program
    at the same time.

  - Fixed game crash when player aims with the whip and exits the game simultaneously by:
    - Addressing a null pointer access in `sithWhip_Reset` when `sithCamera` is already closed.
    - Adding a null check for `sithWeapon_SendMessageAim` before calling `sithWeapon_IsLocalPlayerUnableToUseWeapon`.
    - Added high poly checkbox option to developer dialog (`High poly objects`)
    - Added high poly checkbox option to gameplay options (`High poly objects`)

Game play:
- Fixed the direction of fired projectiles for 2-hand-held weapons by setting the initial direction. This should resolve the issue of random crashes when firing the weapon, as the projectile will now be correctly aimed at the target.
- Fixed damaging player when game runs at > 40 FPS and Taklit's part, Azerim's part or tool from beyond runs out of energy (`sithPlayer_Update`)
- Fixed rendering file list in load game dialog
- Fixed DPI scaling of dialogs
- Fixed bug where controls could become unresponsive when climbing down a whip and pressing the jump-off key simultaneously.
- Enabled HD 3D models by default

Display & Render:
  - Added "simulated" VSync in window mode
  - Added resolution cap to HD resolutions since Direct3D3 doesn't support higher resolutions
  - Fixed raster to use correct vertices buffer when in vertex only mode
  - Fixed clearing raster vertex buffer on startup
  - Added option to disable VSync in `stdDisplay_Update`
  - Fixed rendering of sprite when fog is globally disabled
  - Fixed rendering of polyline when fog is globally disabled
  - Fixed projecting Z coordinate when camera aspect ratio != 1.0
    In addition, this resolves rendering of ceiling sky when aspect ratio != 1.0
  - Fixed screen space projection by correctly applying camera aspect ratio
  - Fixed restoring backbuffer when surface is lost on surface lock
  - Removed hardcoded 16 BPP resolution limitation; the game now defaults to the resolution stored in settings.
  - Removed hardcoded 16 BPP startup resolution limitation when initializing developer dialog allowing for the resolution stored in settings to be selected by default.
  - Set 32 BPP resolution as default
  - Fixed using 32 BPP resolution stored in settings

HUD:
  - (`JonesDialog`) Fixed rendering game background when system dialog box is open
  - Removed help menu option
  - Fixed inventory menu position for wide screen resolutions
  - Fixed inventory menu scaling when aspect ratio is other than 4:3
  - Fixed inventory changed animation position and scaling when aspect ratio is other than 4:3
  - Fixed scaling of HUD health & endurance indicators for screen resolutions other than 4:3
  - Fixed possible menu close lock and game freeze due to uninitialized icon translation move rate.
  - Fixed start icon transition when closing menu.
    Properly initialized move rate for the first transitioning icon, preventing its immediate disappearance.
  - Fixed bug in inventory item change render function (`JonesHud_RenderInventoryItemChange`) which used
    an unbounded yaw value (yaw > 360°) in the calculation of the item's yaw angle. This could lead to
    an infinite loop and prevent the menu from opening.
  - Fixed rotation bug for selected inventory item (`JonesHud_UpdateItem`).
    The yaw added to delta yaw was not bounded to 360 degrees, which could lead to incorrect rotation of the item.
  - Fixed rendering end credits on different screen resolutions
  - Fixed fadeout of credits theme music
  - Increased credits fadeout to 2 sec
